<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![Preview](Images/preview.png)

### Purpose of project

The project is a digital signage system designed for Mosques, allowing for efficient and easy information communication. Previously, the Mosque staff would have to tediously change the prayer times manually on a clock. Now, this is automatically achieved through the system. As well as displaying prayer times, the system is able to communicate more information such as upcoming events or announcements and display donation details enabling attendees to donate. The project aims in keeping the Mosque more organised and gives it the ability to focus on other, less tedious and important tasks.

This project is a personal project and is currently running in my local Mosque and actively used by the local Muslim Community.
